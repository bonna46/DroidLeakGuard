      in API level 26. Use getImei() which returns IMEI for GSM or getMeid() which returns
 MEID for CDMA. Returns the unique device ID of a subscription for example the IMEI for
 GSM and the MEID for CDMA phones. Return null if device ID is not available. Starting with API level 29 persistent device identifiers are guarded behind additional
 restrictions and apps are recommended to use resettable identifiers (see Best practices for unique identifiers ). This
 method can be invoked if one of the following requirements is met: If the calling app has been granted the READ_PRIVILEGED_PHONE_STATE permission; this
     is a privileged permission that can only be granted to apps preloaded on the device. 
If the calling app is the device owner of a fully-managed device a profile
     owner of an organization-owned device or their delegates (see DevicePolicyManager.getEnrollmentSpecificId() ). 
If the calling app has carrier privileges (see hasCarrierPrivileges() ) on any
     active subscription. 
If the calling app is the default SMS role holder (see RoleManager.isRoleHeld(java.lang.String) ). 
If the calling app does not meet one of these requirements then this method will behave
 as follows: If the calling app's target SDK is API level 28 or lower and the app has the
     READ_PHONE_STATE permission then null is returned.
